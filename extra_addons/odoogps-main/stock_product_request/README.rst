====================
BASE Pick and return
====================

Configuration
=============

- Create a Stock route and add the pull rules you want to apply when receiving and sending pickings.
- You can use the auto generated by Odoo if you want to use a transit location.
- If you need to define different rules for returns, you need to create a different rute, or set it manually in the wizard.

Road map
========

* Add the logic to consider if there is any refund rules in the same route.
* Add the logic when the warehouse has two and tree steps for receive and deliver.

Known Issues
============

- The module does not consider what happens if there are rules defined for return in the same route.
- The computation will fail if the warehouse uses two or tree steps and if manually changed, those steps will not be generated.

Usage
=====
